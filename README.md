# 3D_printing_accuracy_characterization
This project contains guides to complete a metrology/resolution analysis on 3D printers.

•	The “SquarePyramid” SolidWorks file is a possible design for the analysis.

•	The Power Point files contain instructions and tips.

•	The “Code and example data for 3 Data Analysis Procedure” folder contains the Matlab code used to extract the data from confocal microscope measurements, as well as actual data obtained using the suggested method.

•	The “Example of metrology analysis data in paper appendices” is what the name suggests.
